## My Masters Research

#### Masters of Computer Science | University of Toronto (2022-2024)

#### Supervisor: Sanja Fidler





## Work Experience

#### Conversational AI for Customer Service Chatbots  â€¢  [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/B1clXX_V1bQ?si=TUZSaT30pYu5dBIJ)  â€¢  [Github](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/NAA/tree/main)  â€¢  [Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-industry.44/)

Applied Machine Learning Intern | Vector Institute (2021)

![Conversational AI](naa.jpg)

- Researched practical methods for creating domain-specific Conversational AI.
- Finetuned LLMs like GPT2 for multiple NLP tasks, adopting existing techniques to create models capable of extracting reasonable answers to queries from a given context in a natural dialogue manner, which perform well in both zero-shot and finetuned settings.
- Implemented a standardized data pipeline into finetuning the model for any domain-specific dataset.





#### Database Management

Data Engineer | Xero - Hubdoc (2020-2021)

- Maintained companyâ€™s data warehouse and data pipeline by creating and debugging ETL jobs using SQL, Javascript, and Python.
- Mapped out dependencies and created new DAGs to migrate the company data pipeline from a hard-coded schedule to Apache Airflow.
- Created dashboards and tables of KPIs for monthly reporting and other requirements.
- Worked with AWS Lambdas, S3, and Redshift to implement better database monitoring and archiving solutions.


## Projects


#### Driving During Quarantine (2020)  â€¢  [Github](https://github.com/DataFestUofT/submit-project-shirley_eva/)  â€¢  [Presentation](https://github.com/DataFestUofT/submit-project-shirley_eva/blob/master/DatafestSlideDeck.pdf)

![Heatmap](torontoheatmap.png)

Won 1st Place Best in Show at the UofT@Datafest2020.

Performed time series analysis using a linear mixed model on traffic data in the Greater Toronto Area to show the effects of the Covid lockdown on Toronto life.


#### Packing Disaster: Educational Video Game to Teach Algebra (2019)  â€¢  [Github](https://github.com/ShirleyWangCVR/PackingDisasterV2)  â€¢  [Development Blog](https://csc399shirty.home.blog/)

![Game Demonstration](solving.png)

Created a video game in C# and Unity, designed to teach basic algebra to children. This is done by representing variables with boxes, and numbers with toys. Done in collaboration with Professor Steve Engels.


#### Rhythm Game in Verilog (2019)  â€¢  [Github](https://github.com/ShirleyWangCVR/CSC258-Rhythm-Game/)

Basic rhythm game programmed entirely in Verilog, played on four keys with some extra code to generate songs.
